            A croissant is a buttery, flaky, French viennoiserie pastry inspired
            by the shape of the Austrian kipferl but using the French
            yeast-leavened laminated dough. Croissants are named for their
            historical crescent shape, the dough is layered with butter, rolled
            and folded several times in succession, then rolled into a thin
            sheet, in a technique called laminating. The process results in a
            layered, flaky texture, similar to a puff pastry. Crescent-shaped
            breads have been made since the Renaissance, and crescent-shaped
            cakes possibly since antiquity but using brioche dough. Kipferls
            have long been a staple of Austrian, and French bakeries and
            pâtisseries. The modern croissant was developed in the early 20th
            century when French bakers replaced the brioche dough of the kipferl
            with a yeast-leavened laminated dough. In the late 1970s, the
            development of factory-made, frozen, preformed but unbaked dough
            made them into a fast food that could be freshly baked by unskilled
            labor. The croissant bakery, notably the La Croissanterie chain, was
            a French response to American-style fast food, and as of 2008,
            30–40% of the croissants sold in French bakeries and patisseries
            were baked from frozen dough. Croissants are a common part of a
            continental breakfast in many European countries.
